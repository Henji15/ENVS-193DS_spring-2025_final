# 1. Research writing

## a. Transparent statistical methods

\[In part 1, they used a correlation test. In part 2, they used an ANOVA test.\]

## b. More information needed

\[The first test would be Tukey Honestly Significantly Different (Tukey HSD) test. It compares which sources are actually different when you compare them (like the average nirogen laod (kg year\^-1). Another test would be calculating the effect size shows how much the grouping variable explains the response variable (how much the source explains the average nitrogen load (kg year\^-1))\]

## c. Suggestions for rewriting

\[In part 1, we found some correlation between distance from headwater (km) and annual total nitrogen load (kg year-1) (pearson's correlation test, r = correlaton coefficient, p = 0.03, $\alpha$ = significance level). For part 2, we found a difference ($\eta$\^2 = effect size) between sources in average nitrogen load (kg year-1) (one-way ANOVA , F(among groups df, within groups df) = test statistic, p = 0.02, $\alpha$ = significance level). On average, urban showed land \_\_ nitrogen load (kg year\^-1) (x kg \_\_, % confidence interval: \[lower bound, upper bound\] kg year\^-1) than atmospheric deposition (this can expanded for more variables).\]

# 2. Data Visualization

## a. Cleaning and summarizing

```{r}
clean_sst <- sst |> # creating a new dataframe
  clean_names() |> # cleaning up data frame
  filter(year(date) >= 2018 & year(date) <= 2023) |> # setting up the range of years that I want
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(date), # converts to date format in R
    year = year(date), # adds new column for year and extracts year part  from each date column
    month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE) # creates a new column for month and extracts month from date column, while abbreviating month name
  ) |>
  group_by(year, month) |> # pairs up the month and year together 
  summarise(mean_monthly_sst = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) |> # calculate mean surface temperature for each month and year group, rename column
  mutate(year=factor(year)) # converts year column to factor for plotting
```

```{r}
slice_sample(clean_sst, n = 5) # showing 5 random rows from dataset
str(clean_sst)

```

## b. Visualize the data

```{r}
graph <- ggplot(data = clean_sst, # choosing the data frame
       aes(x = month, # selecting month data as x-axis
           y = mean_monthly_sst, # selecting mean_monthly_sst as y axis
        color = year, # assign color to year
        shape = year, # assign shape to year
        group = year)) + # assign group to year
  geom_point (shape = 16) + # plot mean_monthly_sst and establish size and shape
  geom_line() + # plot the lines
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Year", # renaming the legend title
    values = c("2018" = "#FFC000", "2019" = "#FF9666", "2020" = "#FB6A4A", "2021" = "#DE2D26", "2022" = "#A50F15", "2023" = "#660000")) + # creating custom colors for the years group
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(), # make panel background blank
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "gray", fill = NA, linewidth = 1), # creating a panel border around the graph
    legend.position = c(0.12, 0.95), # values set for adjusting the margins of legend
    legend.justification = c("right", "top")) + # setting up the type of margins to adjust for 
  labs(x = "Month", # name x-axis as Month
       y = r"[Mean monthly sea surface temperature (°C)]", # name y-axis as Total monthly rain (inches) 
      )

print(graph)
```

# 3. Data analysis

```{r echo = FALSE}
nest_boxes_clean <- nest_boxes |> # creating a new dataframe
  clean_names()
```

## a. Response variable

\[The 1's indicate if that nest box was occupied by the bird of interest (besides the empty category, in which case being empty means 1). The 0's indicate if the nest box was empty or occupied by a bird that was not of interest (besides the empty category, which means it was occupied).\]

## b. Purpose of study

\[Swift parrots tended not to nest in the same place in successive seasons, leaving open boxes for competitors. Other species like the Common Starling preferred to nest in boxes closer to the forest edge, whereas that was the opposite for the Tree Martin.\]

## c. Difference in "seasons"

\[The seasons are the 2016 and 2019 summer breeding seasons for the Swift Parrots. The boxes were just deployed in 2016, whereas the boxes were established for three years by 2019, allowing us to compare how box age affects occupancy and competitors.\]

## d. Table of Models

| model number | season | distance to forest edge | model description |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 |  |  | No predictors (null model) |
| 1 | X | X | Year + Distance (saturated model) |
| 2 | X |  | Year |
| 3 |  | X | Distance to forest edge |

## e. Run the models

```{r}

# null model
model0 <- glm( # generalized lineear model
  sp ~ 1, # no predictors
  data = nest_boxes_clean, # data frame
  family = binomial()) # logistic regression (binary outcome: 1 = occupied, 0 = not)

# all predictor variables (year and distance)
model1 <- glm( # generalized lineear model
  sp ~ season + edge_distance, # both predictor variables
  data = nest_boxes_clean, # data frame
  family = binomial()) # # logistic regression (binary outcome: 1 = occupied, 0 = not)

# year variable
model2 <- glm( # generalized lineear model
  sp ~ season, # just year predictor variable
  data = nest_boxes_clean, # from this data frame
  family = binomial()) # logistic regression (binary outcome: 1 = occupied, 0 = not)

# distance to forest variable
model3 <- glm( # generalized lineear model
  sp ~ edge_distance, # just distance from forest edge predicted variable
  data = nest_boxes_clean, # from this data frame
  family = binomial()) # logistic regression (binary outcome: 1 = occupied, 0 = not)

```

## f.

```{r}
# displaying the plots for each model
# 
Model0 <- plot(simulateResiduals(model0)) # for null model
Model1 <- plot(simulateResiduals(model1)) # for all predictor variables
Model2 <- plot(simulateResiduals(model2)) # for season variable
Model3 <- plot(simulateResiduals(model3)) # for distance from forest edge variable
```

## g. Select the best model

```{r}
AICc(model0,# compute AICc for each model
     model1,
     model2,
     model3) |> 
  arrange(AICc) # arrange in descending order
```

\[The best model as determined by Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) is the one where the year and distance from forest edge predicts Swift parrot nest box occupancy. This was the best as it had the lowest AIC value of 226.31.\]

## h. Visualize the model predictions

```{r}
predicted_vals <- ggpredict(model1, terms = c("edge_distance [all]", "season")) |> # generate model predictions for plotting by choosing the predictor variables for model1
  rename(season = group) # rename group column to seasons for clarification

nest_data <- nest_boxes_clean |> # creating a new dataset
  mutate(
    sp = as.numeric(sp), # convert species abbreviation to numeric
    season = factor(season)) # makes season a factor for plotting

ggplot(data = nest_data, # creating plot and selecting data frame
       aes(x = edge_distance, # set x as edge_distance
           y = sp, # set y as presence of species
           color = season)) + # color by season
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2.2) + # slightly transparent point to make sure they don't overlap

# Add confidence ribbon from model predictions
  geom_ribbon(data = predicted_vals,
              aes(x = x, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, fill = season), # ribbon for CI
              alpha = 0.25, inherit.aes = FALSE) + # do not inherit main plot aesthetics

  geom_line(data = predicted_vals, # Add predicted model line
            aes(x = x, y = predicted, color = season), # prediction lines by season
            linewidth = 1.1, inherit.aes = FALSE) + # set line width

  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = c(0, 1, 0.5)) + # Define y-axis scale and breaks
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("2016" = "#d95f0e", "2019" = "#1b9e77")) +  # Set custom fill and color values for 2016 season
  scale_color_manual(values = c("2016" = "#d95f0e", "2019" = "#1b9e77")) +  # Set custom fill and color values for 2019 season

  theme_classic(base_size = 13) + # clean layout with slightly larger base font
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank(), # Remove panel background
    panel.grid = element_blank(), # Remove grid lines
    axis.ticks = element_line(color = "black"), # Show black axis ticks
    axis.line = element_line(color = "black"), # Show axis lines
    legend.position = c(0.87, 0.6)) + # manually position legend inside the plot

  labs(
  title = "Swift Parrot Nest Box Use based on Distance from Forest Edge", # Main title
  x = "Distance from forest edge (m)", # x-axis label
  y = "Probability of nest box occupancy (%)", # y-axis label
  fill = "Season",  # legend label for fill
  color = "Season") # legend label for color
```

## i. Write a caption for your figure

\[Figure 1 shows the Swift Parrot Nest Box Use based on Distance from Forest Edge. The x axis shows the distance from the forest edge and the y-axis shows the probability of nest box occupancy (%). The red line is from the 2016 season and the green line is from the 2019 season. The shaded ribbons on both lines show the 95% confidence interval around the values predicted by the season and distance from the forest edge. The nests occupied by the Swift Parrot (n = 49) are the points at the top (100% occupancy). The nests not occupied by the Swift Parrots and occupied by other birds or empty (n = 178) are the points at the bottom (0%). For both the 2016 and 2019 season, it appears that the probability of the Swift Parrot's nest box occupancy decreases at it gets further away from the forest edge.

## j. Calculate model predictions

```{r}
ggpredict(model1, # predict values for model 1
          terms = c("edge_distance [0, 900]", "season [2016]")) # across edge distances from 0 to 900 meters for observations of 2016 season
ggpredict(model1, # predict values for model 1
          terms = c("edge_distance [0, 900]", "season [2019]")) # across edge distances from 0 to 900 meters for observations of 2019 season
```
# 4. Affective and exploratory visualizations

## a. Comparing visualizations

\[The visualizations are different from how I represented my data originally. My initial visualization showed two box plots comparing steps on a short or long day (with median, Q1, Q3 shown), whereas my final visualization shows the steps throughout the quarter. I attach the different categories to my steps (extracurriculars, office hours, and food banks) and this was definitely more visual with icons being shown. There's not really much similarities between the two visualizations, as my affective visualization was more like a plot of my steps throughout the quarter with various icons. On the other hand, my exploratory visualization was more bland and just compared two box plots together. Based on my exploratory visualization, it appeared that my longer days tended to have more steps based on the median. I also noticed that in my affective visualization by looking at the average steps, although this was also influenced by whether or not I had extracurriculars as well. A feedback that I got was to put an icon for my screentime data, which I did by adding a clock icon. I also spaced out my data more.\]
